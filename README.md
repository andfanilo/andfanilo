## Hello :wave:

* 🙃 &nbsp; Right now I'm probably building new [Streamlit Components](https://github.com/andfanilo/streamlit-d3-demo) or hanging in [the Streamlit forum](https://discuss.streamlit.io/)
* 💵 &nbsp; My work involves a mix of Advocacy, Product Management and Engineering in Data Science & Business Intelligence [@Worldline](https://worldline.com/)
* 🧑‍💻 &nbsp; I love [to explore customer datasets](https://github.com/andfanilo/ieee-fraud-detection) for value and [(try to) create web demonstrators](https://andfanilo.github.io/quickdraw-minigame) to explain our works
* 🔧 &nbsp; Otherwise I help internal teams get on the Data Analytics train, and [build](https://github.com/andfanilo/cookiecutter-kaggle) [tools](https://github.com/andfanilo/fastapi-vue-crud) to ease our own work
* 🧑‍🎓 &nbsp; I teach [Big Data](https://github.com/andfanilo/pyspark-tutorial) and [NoSQL](https://github.com/andfanilo/vagrant-nosql-python) in Lyon to master students in statistics & BI
* 👥 &nbsp; I occasionally talk at local meetups [(but in french)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwdHFssqtIM) and write tutorials
* 🏸 &nbsp; Out of work, you can find me on a badminton court playing mixed doubles

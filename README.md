## :cherry_blossom: Let's get your Data Projects Noticed

I'm on a quest to help everyone build attractive and thoughtful Data Science, with 12+ years experience in framing business cases for analytics, collecting/processing/exploring your data and showcasing the results in web apps and BI tools. 

My work at [Worldline](https://worldline.com/) involves a mix of Data/AI Strategy, Advocacy/DevRel and Solutions Management. 

I'm also a university lecturer in MLOps, Big Data & NoSQL, and a member of the [Streamlit Creators](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/introducing-streamlit-creators/6207)  Ambassador Program.

### Current goals

* ✨ &nbsp; Continuously improve in Data Science, fullstack web development and design skills through the implementation of data analytics web apps to showcase to the world.
* 👨🏽‍🏫 &nbsp; Promote the Data Analytics field to every type of business and level of public expertise, through content creation, teaching and leading data teams into building production-grade Data Science projects that are valuable for businesses. 
* 🎥 &nbsp; Consistently produce [Youtube video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@andfanilo) that open viewers to new ways of showcasing their Data Projects, all while preserving the fun of learning and deepening their thoughts

### My activities
  
* 💵 &nbsp; I'm actively involved in elaborating and integrating Data Science / BI features for products, projects and bids internally
* 🧑‍💻 &nbsp; I [explore customer datasets](https://github.com/andfanilo/ieee-fraud-detection) for value, [build](https://github.com/andfanilo/cookiecutter-kaggle) [tools](https://github.com/andfanilo/fastapi-vue-crud) to improve our own data projects, and demonstrate our works through talks, workshops and [web demonstrators](https://andfanilo.github.io/quickdraw-minigame).
* 👥 &nbsp; I teach Docker/APIs/PySpark to master students in statistics & BI [here](https://andfanilo.github.io/lyon2/). I also talk at [local meetups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwdHFssqtIM) and [write tutorials](https://streamlit-components-tutorial.netlify.app/).
* 👀 &nbsp; You can find me 🏸 on a badminton court playing mixed doubles or 🎹 near a piano trying to improvise over pop songs.

## Hello :wave:

I'm Fanilo, and my work [@Worldline](https://worldline.com/) involves a mix of Advocacy, Product Management and Engineering in a tight team of Data Science & Business Intelligence experts 

#### Current goals

* ✨ &nbsp; To continuously learn Data Science, frontend web development and presentation design as means to promote the Data Analytics field to every type of business and level of public expertise
* 🙃 &nbsp; Right now I'm probably [building](https://github.com/andfanilo/streamlit-echarts) [Streamlit](https://github.com/andfanilo/streamlit-drawable-canvas) [Components](https://github.com/andfanilo/streamlit-d3-demo) to ease the work of Data Scientists, and I'm open to ideas/requests !

#### My activities

* 💵 &nbsp; I'm actively involved in elaborating and integrating Data Analytics features for products, projects and bids internally. 
* 🧑‍💻 &nbsp; When I can, I [explore customer datasets](https://github.com/andfanilo/ieee-fraud-detection) for value, [build](https://github.com/andfanilo/cookiecutter-kaggle) [tools](https://github.com/andfanilo/fastapi-vue-crud) to improve our own data projects and demonstrate our works through talks, workshops and [custom web demonstrators](https://andfanilo.github.io/quickdraw-minigame)
* 👥 &nbsp; I teach [Big Data](https://github.com/andfanilo/pyspark-tutorial) and [NoSQL](https://github.com/andfanilo/vagrant-nosql-python) in Lyon to master students in statistics & BI. I also occasionally talk at local meetups [(still in french)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwdHFssqtIM) and write tutorials
* 🏸 &nbsp; Out of work, you can find me on a badminton court playing mixed doubles

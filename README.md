I'm Fanilo, I'm on a quest to building attractive Data Science, from framing business cases for analytics to collecting/processing the data and showcasing the results on the web. 

My work [@Worldline](https://worldline.com/) involves a mix of Advocacy/DevRel, Product Management and Engineering Lead for Data Analytics in a tight team of Data Science & Business Intelligence experts.

#### Current goals

* ✨ &nbsp; To continuously improve in Data Science, fullstack web development (mostly frontend/[JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) though) and presentation design as means to promote the Data Analytics field to every type of business and level of public expertise, through teaching, training and leading the implementation of prototypes with best practices.
* 🙃 &nbsp; In my free time I'm probably [building](https://github.com/andfanilo/streamlit-echarts) [Streamlit](https://github.com/andfanilo/streamlit-drawable-canvas) [Components](https://github.com/andfanilo/streamlit-d3-demo) to ease the work of Data Scientists, and **I'm open to ideas/requests !**

#### &nbsp;

I'm on a quest to building attractive and thoughtful Data Science, with 7+ years experience in framing business cases for analytics, collecting/processing/exploring your data and showcasing the results in web apps (one day I'll manage with BI tools too). 

My work at [Worldline](https://worldline.com/) involves a mix of Advocacy/DevRel, Product Management and Engineering Lead for Data Analytics in a tight team of Data Science & Business Intelligence experts. I'm also a university lecturer in Big Data & NoSQL and one of [Streamlit's](https://discuss.streamlit.io/) community moderators.

#### Current goals

* ✨ &nbsp; To continuously improve in Data Science, fullstack web development (though I try to stick to frontend/[JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/)) and presentation design as means to promote the Data Analytics field to every type of business and level of public expertise, through teaching, training and leading the implementation of prototypes with best practices.
* 🙃 &nbsp; In my free time I'm probably [building](https://github.com/andfanilo/streamlit-echarts) [Streamlit](https://github.com/andfanilo/streamlit-drawable-canvas) [Components](https://github.com/andfanilo/streamlit-d3-demo) to ease the work of Data Scientists, and **I'm open to ideas/requests !**

#### My activities
  
* 💵 &nbsp; I'm actively involved in elaborating and integrating Data Science / BI features for products, projects and bids internally
* 🧑‍💻 &nbsp; When I can, I [explore customer datasets](https://github.com/andfanilo/ieee-fraud-detection) for value, [build](https://github.com/andfanilo/cookiecutter-kaggle) [tools](https://github.com/andfanilo/fastapi-vue-crud) to improve our own data projects, and demonstrate our works through talks, workshops and [web demonstrators](https://andfanilo.github.io/quickdraw-minigame)
* 👥 &nbsp; I teach [Big Data](https://github.com/andfanilo/pyspark-tutorial) and [NoSQL](https://github.com/andfanilo/vagrant-nosql-python) in Lyon to master students in statistics & BI. I also occasionally talk at local meetups [(in french)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwdHFssqtIM) and [write tutorials](https://streamlit-components-tutorial.netlify.app/)
* 👀 &nbsp; You can find me 🏸 on a badminton court playing mixed doubles, 🎹 near a piano trying to improvise over pop songs, or hanging in the [Streamlit community](https://discuss.streamlit.io/).
